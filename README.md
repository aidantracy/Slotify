## Project Description:
We will be designing a web app with a similar functionality to the meeting
booking website [youcanbookme.com]([https://www.example.com](https://youcanbook.me/#:~:text=YouCanBookMe%20lets%20you%20create%20the%20best%20booking%20experience%20for%20your))
Users will be able to set a defined number of meeting times on their own calendar to then
have meetings set up with other users or interact with other user's meeting times to set up 
a meeting.

## Miscellaneous information
We researched how to deploy the site online. We looked at using both AWS and GitHub Pages.
We decided that GitHub Pages was the best, easiest option., so we setup the repository to work with them.
